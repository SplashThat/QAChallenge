the best tests and coach the team to meet their best in terms of quality.

## Challenge Description
Please, create a test plan with the test cases you think should be covered in this page. You don't need to automate all of them, just the ones that you consider more important oor critical in this scenario.

### Selenium tests
Using Selenium, implement an automated test suite to cover our login and sign up flow. Here is the login page URL: `https://splashthat.com/login`.

For development, you should use Selenium WebDriver in Python or Java. We recommend using Python because it's the easiest to set up, and it's the language we use for Selenium tests right now but, feel free to choose the language you are most comfortable with.
This repository provides you with bare-bones scripts to get started with any of those.

### API testing
Using python request library provide automated tests for API to cover POST, GET, UPDATE AND DELETE on an endpoint. Use https://crudcrud.com/ to create your APIs that can be used for CRUD operations in your tests.

## Setup Instructions
1. Download the Selenium WebDriver Language Bindings of your choosing here: https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/#selenium_ide
2. Open the text editor of your choice and navigate to the folder that corresponds to the language of your choice
3. Have fun!

## Submitting your work
You may submit your work via Github, uploading your code to GitHub as a private repository and *add Splash Collaborators.* Go to `Settings > Collaborators & Teams` and add the Splash team: @cupeiro-splash, @laurapzc, @naziazafor and @samsplashqa

## Challenge Goals
We'll go over your challenge during your onsite interview, so make sure you produce something you're proud of and be ready to explain the methodology used to develop the test.
